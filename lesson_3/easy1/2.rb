# Describe the difference between ! and ? in ruby
# 
# != means "does not equal"
# ! before something like !user_name means it turns into the opposite of a boolean equivalent
# ! after something like words.uniq! is part of the method so cant say for sure
# ? before something is boolean expression, ternary operator for if...else
# ? after something is part of the method so cant say for sure
# !! before something !!<some_object> turns into a boolean eqquivalent
